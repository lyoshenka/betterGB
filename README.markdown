BetterGB
========

BetterGB is a chrome extension that makes the Google Bookmarks bookmarklet suck less. 

I think Google Bookmarks is a great service. It lets me bookmark everything, does full-text search on the bookmarked pages (so I don't have to tag if I don't feel like it) and integrates with google search. It's a real shame that Google has been neglecting this service for so long. After their latest UI redesign, the bookmarklet became borderline unusable. So I finally got fed up and decided to fix it.

Features
--------

* Improves highlighting of selected autocomplete choice for tag
* Removes extraneous UI stuff
* Fixes the tabindex so you only tab through the fields you want (name, location, labels, add bookmark)
* Close popup by pressing Esc
* Options can turn many of these features on or off

Install

Coming soon
