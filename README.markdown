BetterGB
========

BetterGB is a chrome extension that makes the Google Bookmarks bookmarklet suck less.

I think Google Bookmarks is a great service. It lets me bookmark everything, does full-text search on the bookmarked pages (so I don't have to tag if I don't feel like it) and integrates with google search. It's a real shame that Google has been neglecting this service for so long. After their latest UI redesign, the bookmarklet became borderline unusable. So I finally got fed up and decided to fix it.

Features
--------

* Improves highlighting of selected autocomplete choice for tag
* Removes extraneous UI elements (configurable)
* Fixes the tabindex so you only tab through the fields you want (name, location, labels, add bookmark)
* Save bookmark by pressing Enter (the way it used to work before the redesign)
* Close popup by pressing Esc
* Options can turn many of these features on or off

Install
-------

[**Click here to install**](https://github.com/lyoshenka/betterGB/blob/master/release/bettergb-15.crx?raw=true "Click to install")

To configure extension options, open the Google bookmarklet and click "BetterGB Options" in the bottom-left corner.

Feature Requests
----------------

Is there something you wish the bookmarklet did that it doesn't do right now? File an issue, submit a pull request, or shoot me a message. I'm usually pretty responsive.
